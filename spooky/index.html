	      			<h1>About Spooky Adventure</h1>
			  	<p>'Super Mario Spooky Adventure', simply Spooky Adventure, is a one-world hack of New Super Mario Bros. Wii, based on the Newer framework. <br> It revolves around a spooky setting, taking place on an island overrun with ghosts, undead, and much more!</p>
				<br>
				<h1>How big will the mod be?</h1>
				<p>Well, the mod is currently going to have 10 normal levels, an 'alternative' level, one tower, two castles, as well as maybe some bonus content???</p>
				<br>
				<h1>The Story</h1>
				<p>"Mario and co. land on a mysterious island shortly after their previous adventure, however it doesn't take long before the princess is missing once more!" <br> Journey along through a world of unique environments in many different settings! Jump across trees, disturb the dead, treak through the finest pumpkin patch around, travel on a boat through a poisonous lake, tread cautiously across fragile rocks, climb a cliff while having barrels and spike balls hurled at you from above, and even face off against Bowser, who's behind all of this!<br>Perhaps if you get <em>everything</em> along the way, a much greater reward will be given...</p>
