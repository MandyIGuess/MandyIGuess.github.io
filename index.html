			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hi, I'm MandyIGuess! You can call me Mandy for short though.<br>I'm a 14yrs old <em>male</em> living in the USA! My gender pronouns are He/Him/His.<br>My timezone is UTC-4 (better known as "the time that NYC uses"), and I'm usually active from 3PM to 12AM on week days, and from 8AM to 2AM on weekends!<br>If you want to find out more about me, go <a href="aboutme">here</a>!</p>

			<h1><a href="../junkdrawer">My Junk Drawer</a></h1>
			<p>This is my 'junk drawer', a collection of random crap and other miscellaneous things I don't want, and I <em>hope</em> you don't want either. What will mostly be here is my old NSMBW modding assets, like my 'remakes' of classic Mario games, and other levels I will never get to finishing. Feel free to sift through it, and take what you want I guess...</p>
