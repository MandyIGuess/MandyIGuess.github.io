			<h1><a href="../junkdrawer/index.html">My Junk Drawer</a></h1>
			<p>This is my 'junk drawer', a collection of random crap and other miscellaneous things I don't want, and I <em>hope</em> you don't want either. What will mostly be here is my old NSMBW modding assets, like my 'remakes' of classic Mario games, and other levels I will never get to finishing. Feel free to sift through it, and take what you want I guess...</p>
